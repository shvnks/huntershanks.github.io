            <description>&lt;p&gt;Some cool news came about yesterday. ISSessions had their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu28GgjoEfQ&#34;&gt;recap&lt;/a&gt; meeting where they released some statistics from the CTF including the top 100 players.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some cool news came about yesterday. ISSessions had their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu28GgjoEfQ">recap</a> meeting where they released some statistics from the CTF including the top 100 players.</p>
<p>I did better than expected considering this was my first CTF that I&rsquo;ve partaken live; I had some experience with <a href="https://picoctf.org/">picoCTF</a>. I placed 21st overall with 808 points total.</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/issessions2023.png" alt="ISSessions2023-standing"></p>
<p>In total, I had 15 number of solves. I just managed to get at least 1 solve in each category. I&rsquo;m hoping to improve significantly in my upcoming CTFs. Ideally I would like to get good with reverse engineering but that is a steep slope. It&rsquo;ll take a lot of work but I&rsquo;m sure it will pay off in the end.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to help me improve my skills with Hugo, I figured I would mention something regarding the writeups for the Advent of Cyber.</p>
<p>I did in fact complete the entire challenge as seen <a href="https://tryhackme.com/.shanks/badges/adventofcyber4">here</a>. I was running out of time since I was still doing final exams and once I finished that, it was time to spend the holidays with friends and family. I don&rsquo;t think I will finish the writeups since I feel overwhelmed with the amount left.</p>
<p>I will likely do a few writeups for the <a href="https://issessions.ca/2023/01/issessions-2023-01-12/">ISSessions 2023 CTF</a>.</p>]]></content>

<h4 id="use-the-ls-command-to-list-the-files-present-in-the-current-directory-how-many-log-files-are-present">Use the <code>ls</code> command to list the files present in the current directory. How many log files are present?</h4>
<p>Make sure your current working directory is <code>/home/elfmcblue</code>. If you do not know, run this command: <code>pwd</code></p>

<p>Make sure your current working directory is <code>/home/elfmcblue</code>. If you do not know, run this command: <code>pwd</code></p>
<p>We are looking for a webserver log file, conveniently, we notice <code>webserver.log</code> exists within the <code>/home/elfmcblue</code> directory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ls

<p>Our first attempt with <code>grep</code>. We chose the <code>-i</code> option because we aren&rsquo;t sure how the word <code>stolen</code> will be written in the log files. Furthermore since we are interested in the webserver logs, we will grep through that file. We notice that the date is November 18th. Checking our calendar, that leads us to the answer. Another possible way to arrive to this conclusion is</p>

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Friday
</code></pre><h4 id="what-is-the-ip-address-of-the-attacker">What is the IP address of the attacker?</h4>
<p>In the output of the above grep command, we notice that the IP address is shown in the logs. This IP address is particularly persistent in its requests to the webserver. Therefore we can infer that the IP address making these requests is from the attacker.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>10.10.249.191
</code></pre><h4 id="what-is-the-name-of-the-important-list-that-the-attacker-stole-from-santa">What is the name of the important list that the attacker stole from Santa?</h4>
<p>Knowing that the file we are looking for is a <code>list</code>, we can infer that the most likely name format of this list would be <code>something_list.txt</code> or <code>someList.txt</code>. It is common practice to use a easily readable file format like <code>.txt</code> extension. Therefore we use <code>-i</code> to ignore the case in the event that the list is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case">snake case</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">camel case</a>. We could have used the <code>-r</code> option instead of specifying the <code>webserver.log</code> file in case there were more than 2 files in the current working directory. However, it was most likely going to be logged within the <code>webserver.log</code> file so we chose that option instead.</p>

<p>Using the <code>-r</code> option, we recursively iterate through all of the files within the current working directory (<code>pwd</code>) and search for the beginning portion of the flag format that consistantly remains the same: <code>&quot;THM{&quot;</code>.</p>

<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is OSINT, and what techniques can extract useful information against a website or target?</li>
<li>Using dorks to find specific information on the Google search engine</li>
<li>Extracting hidden directories through the Robots.txt file</li>
<li>Domain owner information through WHOIS lookup</li>
<li>Searching data from hacked databases</li>
<li>Acquiring sensitive information from publicly available GitHub repositories</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-is-the-name-of-the-registrar-for-the-domain-santagiftshop">What is the name of the Registrar for the domain santagift.shop?</h4>
<p>By going to the <a href="https://who.is/whois/github.com">WHOIS</a> lookup website, we enter either of the provided domains: <code>santagift.shop</code> or <code>qa.santagift.shop</code> and you will see that the Registar name is NameCheap Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>NAMECHEAP INC
</code></pre><h4 id="find-the-websites-source-code-repository-on-githubcom-and-open-the-file-containing-sensitive-credentials-can-you-find-the-flag">Find the website&rsquo;s source code (repository) on github.com and open the file containing sensitive credentials. Can you find the flag?</h4>
<p>Reading through the <a href="https://github.com/muhammadthm/SantaGiftShop/blob/main/README.md">Github&rsquo;s README</a>, leads you to the <a href="https://github.com/muhammadthm/SantaGiftShop/blob/main/config.php">config.php</a> file which is where you will find the flag on <code>line 2</code>.
<strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{THM_OSINT_WORKS}
</code></pre><h4 id="what-is-the-name-of-the-file-containing-passwords">What is the name of the file containing passwords?</h4>
<p>Coincidentally, the same <a href="https://github.com/muhammadthm/SantaGiftShop/blob/main/config.php">config.php</a> file from above also contains the passwords.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>config.php
</code></pre><h4 id="what-is-the-name-of-the-qa-server-associated-with-the-website">What is the name of the QA server associated with the website?</h4>
<p>The answer can be deduced either from the <a href="https://github.com/muhammadthm/SantaGiftShop/blob/main/README.md">README</a>, where they mention the 2 main domains: <code>santagift.shop</code> or <code>qa.santagift.shop</code>, which you can use deductive reasoning. In addition if you checkout the <a href="https://github.com/muhammadthm/SantaGiftShop/blob/main/config.php">config.php</a> you will see on <code>line 20</code>, a comment that states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incase of QA, it will be qa.santagift.shop</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus we have found the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>qa.santagift.shop
</code></pre><h4 id="what-is-the-db_password-that-is-being-reused-between-the-qa-and-prod-environments">What is the DB_PASSWORD that is being reused between the QA and PROD environments?</h4>

This challenge involves learning about brute-force attacks that an attacker can use in an attempt to penetrate a system/service/application.</p>
<h4 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Learn about common remote access services.</li>
<li>Recognize a listening VNC port in a port scan.</li>
<li>Use a tool to find the VNC server’s password.</li>
<li>Connect to the VNC server using a VNC client.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="use-hydra-to-find-the-vnc-password-of-the-target-with-ip-address-machine_ip-what-is-the-password">Use Hydra to find the VNC password of the target with IP address <code>MACHINE_IP</code>. What is the password?</h4>
<p>Before we begin using Hydra, we can use <code>nmap</code> to see that there is a vnc service running on our target machine:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">user@hostName:~$ sudo nmap -sS MACHINE_IP

</code></pre></div><p>Now onward to using hydra. For this we don&rsquo;t pass any username (<code>-l</code> option) but we will be using the popular <code>rockyou.txt</code> file which contains the worlds most common passwords. We will accomplish the task using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">user@hostName:~$ hydra -P /path/to/rockyou.txt MACHINE_IP vnc
</code></pre></div><p>Below is the output from using the above command in the AttackBox:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/hydra-pw.png" alt="hydra"></p>
<p>We notice that after some time, hydra does in fact find the password to the vnc server via brute-force.</p>

What is the flag written on the target’s screen?</h4>
<p>To retrieve the flag, you need an RDP client that supports the VNC protocol to access the machine. I used the included <a href="https://www.remmina.org/">Remmina</a> client within the AttackBox to gain access to the target machine. To log into the device you can follow THM&rsquo;s steps or read them below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch <a href="https://www.remmina.org/">Remmina</a></li>
</ol>

<li>Close the <code>Unlock Login Keyring</code> dialog box if it appears.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../imgs/dialog.png" alt="dialog"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Change the protocol to VNC.</li>
<li>Enter the IP Address of the target system.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="what-is-the-email-address-of-the-sender">What is the email address of the sender?</h4>
<p>Following the guide that TryHackMe showed us, we use the given command <strong>after</strong> we <code>cd</code> into the <code>Desktop</code> directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ emlAnalyzer -i Urgent<span style="color:#ae81ff">\:</span>.eml --header --html -u --text --extract-all
</code></pre></div><p>Looking at the output of the <code>emlAnalyzer</code> command under the <code>Header</code> section we see:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/sender.png" alt="sender"></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>chief.elf@santaclaus.thm
</code></pre><h4 id="what-is-the-return-address">What is the return address?</h4>
<p>Looking at the output of the <code>emlAnalyzer</code> command under the <code>Header</code> section we see:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/return-path.png" alt="return-path"></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>murphy.evident@bandityeti.thm
</code></pre><h4 id="on-whose-behalf-was-the-email-sent">On whose behalf was the email sent?</h4>
<p>Looking at the output of the <code>emlAnalyzer</code> command under the <code>Header</code> section we see:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/sender.png" alt="sender"></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Chief Elf
</code></pre><h4 id="what-is-the-x-spam-score">What is the X-spam score?</h4>
<p>Looking at the output of the <code>emlAnalyzer</code> command under the <code>Header</code> section we see:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/spam-score.png" alt="spam-score"></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>3
</code></pre><h4 id="what-is-hidden-in-the-value-of-the-message-id-field">What is hidden in the value of the Message-ID field?</h4>
<p>Looking at the output of the <code>emlAnalyzer</code> command under the <code>Header</code> section we see:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/msg-id.png" alt="msg-id"></p>
<p>Now we notice that the <code>Message-Id</code> is written in Base64 [you can tell by the length of the ID and the hexadecimal values given], from here we use a base64 decoder of our choosing. I google base64 decoder and <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/">here</a> was the first link that I got. Now we only insert this: <code>QW9DMjAyMl9FbWFpbF9BbmFseXNpcw==</code> portion of the ID since the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> characters simply indicate the beginning and end of the ID. The answer is the output from the base64 decoder.</p>

<p>We visit the <a href="https://emailrep.io/">Email Reputation Analyzer</a> from the guide and enter the senders email: <code>murphy.evident@bandityeti.thm</code></p>
<p><img src="../imgs/risky.png" alt="risky"></p>
<p>We see that the email is flagged as risky.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>risky
</code></pre><h4 id="check-the-attachments-what-is-the-filename-of-the-attachment">Check the attachments. What is the filename of the attachment?</h4>
<p>From the original <code>emlAnalyzer</code> command that we ran earlier, we can see in our <code>Desktop</code> folder that a new folder named <code>eml-attachments</code> has appeared after completing. From the terminal, we shall <code>cd</code> into that directory and look for the attachment name. Notice that if you attempt to open it that we get an error. The VM is hinting that the file may not be what it seems based on the error output.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>Division _ of _ labour-Load_share_plan.doc
</code></pre><h4 id="what-is-the-hash-value-of-the-attachment">What is the hash value of the attachment?</h4>
<p>Now we will use the <code>sha256sum</code> to calculate the file&rsquo;s hash value. Below is the output of that command.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ sha256sum Division _ of _ labour-Load_share_plan.doc

<h4 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explain what smart contracts are, how they relate to the blockchain, and why they are important.</li>
<li>Understand how contracts are related, what they are built upon, and standard core functions.</li>
<li>Understand and exploit a common smart contract vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-flag-is-found-after-attacking-the-provided-etherstore-contract">What flag is found after attacking the provided EtherStore Contract?</h4>
<p><strong>Preface:</strong> This is not my area of expertise, in fact blockchain technology is where my cyber security skills are the weakest so this challenge took me longer than I&rsquo;d like to admit. However, by reading through the instructions several times I was able to retrieve the flag successfully.</p>
<p>As for the method to retrieve the flag, follow the instructions until you get to <code>Step 4</code>. From here it feels vague but all that needs to be done is put a value [preferably small since it will consume a lot of memory otherwise, for reference I used <code>1</code>], and select the <code>Attack</code> contract.</p>
<p>From there you scroll down to <code>Deployed Contracts</code> and click attack and wait for the <code>console.log</code> to return the flag.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>flag{411_ur_37h_15_m1n3}
