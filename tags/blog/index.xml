      <title>0x5 - First North Sec Experience</title>

      <description>This year was my first ever attendance to the North Sec cyber security event. It is Canada&amp;rsquo;s largest cyber security event, consisting of 3 parts: the conference, competition (CTF) and trainings, spanning nearly a week. Depending on which package you buy, you will be given various &amp;lsquo;swag&amp;rsquo; and other items for the various events. In my case, I bought the early bird conference and competition combo since I was still a student at the time (students got a 50% off promotion code) and wanted to do some networking.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a few weeks but I received some great news on March 28th 2023. I was one of the three winners for the MagpieCTF 2023 writeups portion.
They announced the winners in their Discord server on the announcements channel.
This was a big win for me since it was my first time attempting the writeups officially. I hope to bring more writeups in the future and furhter improve my skills to transfer the knowledge that I&amp;rsquo;ve gained through my experiences with this challenges.</description>
